The relevant GitHub source is listed on its [Paper with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/point-set-registration-coherent-point-drift) page.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-set_registration): When the two point sets are optimally aligned, the correspondence is the maximum of the GMM posterior probability for a given data point. To preserve the topological structure of the point sets, the GMM centroids are forced to move coherently as a group. The expectation maximization algorithm is used to optimize the cost function.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-set_registration): Sums of Gaussian distributions can be computed in linear time using the fast Gauss transform (FGT). Consequently, the time complexity of CPD is $O(M+N)$, which is asymptotically much faster than $O(MN)$ methods.},  doi       = {10.1109/tpami.2010.46},  file      = {:Article/Myronenko_A_2010 Point Set Registration_ Coherent Point Drift.pdf:PDF},  groups    = {Point Cloud Registration, body scan, finite element breast},  priority  = {prio3},  progress  = {read 7},  publisher = {Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ({IEEE})},}"
