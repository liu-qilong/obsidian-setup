# My [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) setup

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as my major note taking tool. This repository stores my customized templates including:

- PaperThread: Visualize papers' relations as threads
- TagLens: Show related notes in different types
- DailyLens: Benchmark my time spend, task completions, and other acitvities

## PaperThread

Visualize papers' relations as threads:

Generate `bibtex` of all papers for $\LaTeX$:

Retrieve a paper's meta data via `doi`:

## TagLens

Show related notes in different types:

_P.S. For a container page, you need to specify a `tag name` for it in the `alias` field, so that any note page attached with this tag will appear in this container. Obsidian plugin [Tag Wrangler](https://github.com/pjeby/tag-wrangler) is particularly handy for managing nested-tags._

## DailyLens

Benchmarks my time spend, task completions, and other acitvities

## Setup

Clone this repository and place it under your Obsidian vault. Them you can create container pages _(topic, project, paper thread, etc.)_ and note pages _(note, paper, dairy, etc.)_ with templates under `utils/template`. Noted that these tempaltes works the best with Obsidian plugin [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater).
